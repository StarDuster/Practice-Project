#A load test script based on ApacheBench

Some of my work in NetEase.

loadtest.sh is a bash script to call Apachebench(ab) to do web load testing.

another loadtest.sh is for https test of TLS handshake.

watch.sh is a bash script to call netstat to watch the status of the connections.

watch.sh for server remove the timeout conuter, easier to see what happend.
