# A load test script based on ApacheBench

Some of my work in NetEase.

`loadtest.sh` is a bash script to call Apachebench(ab) to do web load testing.

another one is for https test of TLS handshake.

`watch.sh` is a bash script to call netstat to watch the status of the connections.

`watch_proxy_server.sh` for server remove the timeout conuter, easier to see what happend.
